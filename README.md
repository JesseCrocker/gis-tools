# GISTools
GIS tools for Swift, including a [GeoJSON][3] implementation and many algorithms ported from [https://turfjs.org][4].

## Notes

This package makes some assumptions about what is equal, i.e. coordinates that are inside of `1e-10` degrees are regarded as equal. See `GISTool.equalityDelta`.

## Requirements

This package requires Swift 5.7 or higher (at least Xcode 13), and compiles on iOS (\>= iOS 13), macOS (\>= macOS 10.15), tvOS (\>= tvOS 13), watchOS (\>= watchOS 6) as well as Linux.

## Installation with Swift Package Manager

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Outdooractive/gis-tools", from: "0.5.2"),
],
targets: [
    .target(name: "MyTarget", dependencies: [
        .product(name: "GISTools", package: "gis-tools"),
    ]),
]
```

## Features

- Supports the full [GeoJSON standard][5], with some exceptions (see `TODO.md`)
- Load and write GeoJSON objects from and to `[String:Any]`, `URL`, `Data` and `String`
- Supports `Codable`
- Supports WKT/WKB
- Spatial search with a R-tree
- Supports EPSG:3857 (web mercator) and EPSG:4326 (geodetic) conversions
- Includes many spatial algorithms, and more to come

Please see also the [API documentation][6].

## Usage
```swift
import GISTools

var feature = Feature(Point(Coordinate3D(latitude: 3.870163, longitude: 11.518585)))
feature.properties = [
    "test": 1,
    "test2": 5.567,
    "test3": [1, 2, 3],
    "test4": [
        "sub1": 1,
        "sub2": 2
    ]
]

// To and from String:
let jsonString = feature.asJsonString(prettyPrinted: true)
let feature = Feature(jsonString: jsonString)

// To and from Data:
let jsonData = feature.asJsonData(prettyPrinted: true)
let feature = Feature(jsonData: jsonData)

// Using Codable:
let jsonData = try JSONEncoder().encode(feature)
let feature = try JSONDecoder().decode(Feature.self, from: jsonData)

// Generic:
let someGeoJson = GeoJsonReader.geoJsonFrom(json: [
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [100.0, 0.0],
])
let someGeoJson = GeoJsonReader.geoJsonFrom(contentsOf: URL(...))
let someGeoJson = GeoJsonReader.geoJsonFrom(jsonData: Data(...))
let someGeoJson = GeoJsonReader.geoJsonFrom(jsonString: "{\"type\":\"Point\",\"coordinates\":[100.0,0.0]}")

switch someGeoJson {
case let point as Point: ...
}
// or
switch someGeoJson.type {
case .point: ...
}

// Wraps *any* GeoJSON into a FeatureCollection
let featureCollection = FeatureCollection(jsonData: someData)
let featureCollection = try JSONDecoder().decode(FeatureCollection.self, from: someData)

...
```

See the [tests for more examples][7] and also the [API documentation][8].

## WKB/WKT
The following geometry types are supported: `point`, `linestring`, `linearring`, `polygon`, `multipoint`, `multilinestring`, `multipolygon`, `geometrycollection` and `triangle`. Please open an issue if you need more.

Every GeoJSON object has convenience methods to encode and decode themselves to and from WKB/WKT, and there are extensions for `Data` and `String` to decode from WKB and WKT to GeoJSON. In the end, they all forward to `WKBCoder` and `WKTCoder` which do the heavy lifting.

### WKB
Also have a look at  the tests: [WKB test cases][20]

Decoding:
```swift
// SELECT 'POINT Z (1 2 3)'::geometry;
private let pointZData = Data(hex: "0101000080000000000000F03F00000000000000400000000000000840")!

// Generic
let point = try WKBCoder.decode(wkb: pointData, projection: .epsg4326) as! Point
let point = pointZData.asGeoJsonGeometry(projection: .epsg4326) as! Point

// Or create the geometry directly
let point = Point(wkb: pointZData, projection: .epsg4326)!

// Or create a Feature that contains the geometry
let feature = Feature(wkb: pointZData, projection: .epsg4326)
let feature = pointZData.asFeature(projection: .epsg4326)

// Or create a FeatureCollection that contains a feature with the geometry
let featureCollection = FeatureCollection(wkb: pointZData, projection: .epsg4326)
let featureCollection = pointZData.asFeatureCollection(projection: .epsg4326)
```

Encoding:
```swift
let point = Point(Coordinate3D(latitude: 0.0, longitude: 100.0))

// Generic
let encodedPoint = WKBCoder.encode(geometry: point, projection: nil)

// Convenience
let encodedPoint = point.asWKB
```

### WKT
This is exactly the same as WKBâ€¦ Also have a look at the tests to see how it works: [WKT test cases][21]

Decoding:
```swift
private let pointZString = "POINT Z (1 2 3)"

// Generic
let point = try WKTCoder.decode(wkt: pointZString, projection: .epsg4326) as! Point
let point = pointZString.asGeoJsonGeometry(projection: .epsg4326) as! Point

// Or create the geometry directly
let point = Point(wkt: pointZString, projection: .epsg4326)!

// Or create a Feature that contains the geometry
let feature = Feature(wkt: pointZString, projection: .epsg4326)
let feature = pointZString.asFeature(projection: .epsg4326)

// Or create a FeatureCollection that contains a feature with the geometry
let featureCollection = FeatureCollection(wkt: pointZString, projection: .epsg4326)
let featureCollection = pointZString.asFeatureCollection(projection: .epsg4326)
```

Encoding:
```swift
let point = Point(Coordinate3D(latitude: 0.0, longitude: 100.0))

// Generic
let encodedPoint = WKTCoder.encode(geometry: point, projection: nil)

// Convenience
let encodedPoint = point.asWKT
```

## Spatial index
This package includes a simple R-tree implementation: [RTree test cases][22]

```swift
var nodes: [Point] = []
50.times {
    nodes.append(Point(Coordinate3D(
        latitude: Double.random(in: -10.0 ... 10.0),
        longitude: Double.random(in: -10.0 ... 10.0))))
    }

let rTree = RTree(nodes)
let objects = rTree.search(inBoundingBox: boundingBox)
let objectsAround = rTree.search(aroundCoordinate: center, maximumDistance: maximumDistance)
```
